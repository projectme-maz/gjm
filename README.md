# Stock Opname

Static web application for stock-opname reconciliation. GitHub Actions publishes it to GitHub Pages whenever a commit is pushed to `main`. Supabase provides staff authentication and shared team data.

## Publish with GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repository and add this project to it.
2. Make sure the deployment workflow and `index.html` are committed on the `main` branch.
3. In the repository, open **Settings → Pages** and set **Build and deployment → Source** to **GitHub Actions**. This one-time setting must be enabled by a repository administrator.
4. Push a commit to `main`, or run **Deploy to GitHub Pages** from the repository's **Actions** tab.
5. Once the workflow succeeds, open the Pages URL shown in the deployment job (normally `https://<account>.github.io/<repository>/`).

The workflow packages only `index.html` for publishing. The spreadsheet parser is loaded from jsDelivr, so users need an internet connection to use workbook import/export features.

## Supabase authentication and shared data

The browser app uses the Supabase project URL and publishable key in `index.html`. A publishable key is intended for browser use; never put a Supabase secret or `service_role` key in this repository.

1. In Supabase **Authentication → Settings**, disable public sign-ups.
2. In **Authentication → URL Configuration**, set **Site URL** to `https://projectme-maz.github.io/gjm/` and add that same address under **Redirect URLs**.
3. In **SQL Editor → New query**, paste the contents of [`supabase-setup.sql`](./supabase-setup.sql), and click **Run**. This creates the shared-state table and a private username-to-auth-account mapping table.
4. Install the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli), then open a terminal in this project folder and deploy both Edge Functions:

   ```powershell
   npx.cmd --yes supabase login
   npx.cmd --yes supabase link --project-ref kdeculjdbmhhhnqaonzb
   npx.cmd --yes supabase functions deploy login-with-username --project-ref kdeculjdbmhhhnqaonzb
   npx.cmd --yes supabase functions deploy provision-stock-users --project-ref kdeculjdbmhhhnqaonzb
   npx.cmd --yes supabase functions deploy admin-users --project-ref kdeculjdbmhhhnqaonzb
   ```

   On PowerShell, use `npx.cmd` rather than `npx` if script execution is blocked. The functions use Supabase's built-in server-side credentials. Never put a secret or `service_role` key in browser code or commit one to GitHub.

5. Publish the updated `index.html` to GitHub Pages before creating the staff accounts. The updated app is required to securely verify the temporary password and force each person to replace it on first login.
6. Run the following in the same PowerShell window to create the 19 staff accounts. It creates a random one-time provisioning key, saves it only as a Supabase Edge Function secret, and calls the protected function. The function generates one random temporary password for newly created accounts; it is shown in the result only once.

   ```powershell
   $bytes = New-Object byte[] 32
   $rng = [Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::Create()
   $rng.GetBytes($bytes)
   $provisionKey = [Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes).TrimEnd('=').Replace('+', '-').Replace('/', '_')
   $rng.Dispose()

   npx.cmd --yes supabase secrets set "STOCK_OPNAME_PROVISION_KEY=$provisionKey" --project-ref kdeculjdbmhhhnqaonzb

   $publishableKey = "sb_publishable_w2fpQZE11m9h00HAXNNFTA_5L7i_Jlf"
   $headers = @{
     apikey = $publishableKey
     Authorization = "Bearer $publishableKey"
     "x-provisioning-key" = $provisionKey
   }
   $result = Invoke-RestMethod `
     -Uri "https://kdeculjdbmhhhnqaonzb.supabase.co/functions/v1/provision-stock-users" `
     -Method Post -Headers $headers -ContentType "application/json" -Body "{}"
   $result | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
   ```

   Confirm that `failed` is empty and check the `created` and `existing` lists. Keep the temporary password private and share it directly with staff. Then disable the one-time provisioning endpoint by removing its key:

   ```powershell
   npx.cmd --yes supabase secrets unset STOCK_OPNAME_PROVISION_KEY --project-ref kdeculjdbmhhhnqaonzb
   Remove-Variable provisionKey, headers, result, publishableKey, bytes, rng
   ```

   To reset a staff password later, create and set a new provisioning key as above, then call the same endpoint with `-Body '{"action":"reset-password","username":"indra"}'` (replace `indra` with the lowercase username). It returns a random temporary password; the staff member must change it at their next login. For an administrator-approved bulk reset, use `action: "reset-all-passwords"` with a temporary password supplied in the request body. This resets every listed staff account and forces a password change on next login. Remove the secret again when finished.

7. Open the deployed application. Staff log in with their lowercase username (`indra`, `dinar`, `beni`, `rosadi`, `ivan`, `iyant`, `arief`, `dimas`, `bara`, `rino`, `ahmad`, `rangga`, `dyah`, `putri`, `boniex`, `andri`, `fadhil`, `yusuf`, or `yoga`) and the temporary password. On first login, each person must set a new password of at least 8 characters.
8. The first successful login creates the shared workspace record. If this browser has existing locally saved app data, that data is used to initialize the shared record. Back up important data before setup.

Authenticated staff share one workspace dataset. Changes are saved to Supabase and other open sessions check for updates every eight seconds. Data is no longer limited to the local browser after the shared record has been initialized.

The generated `@users.stock-opname.invalid` addresses are internal identifiers only; staff do not need personal email addresses and cannot receive password recovery email. If someone forgets a password, an administrator must reset it. The SQL keeps the username mapping private from browser users, does not grant database access to anonymous visitors, and does not allow authenticated users to delete the shared record. Every staff account can read and edit the shared stock-opname data; give the temporary password only to trusted staff.

The `indra` account is the workspace super admin. After signing in, Indra can open **Kelola Akun** to create staff usernames, reset their passwords, and disable or re-enable accounts. Admin actions are checked by the `admin-users` Edge Function against the user's server-managed Supabase `app_metadata`; ordinary staff cannot call these actions by changing browser data. This role grants control inside this workspace application, not ownership of the GitHub repository or Supabase project dashboard.
